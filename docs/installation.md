## Run

Start the app in the `dev` environment. This starts the main process with hot updates using [**electronmon**](https://github.com/catdad/electronmon) and the renderer process in [**hot-module-replacement**](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/#enabling-hmr) mode and starts a webpack dev server that sends hot updates to the renderer process:

```bash
npm start
```
