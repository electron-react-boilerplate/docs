## Webpack Configurations

Webpack configs are located inside the `./configs` directory

## Internal Scripts

The scripts inside the `.erb/scripts` handle functionality that cannot be written as npm scripts.

The scripts are the following:

- `check-build-exists.js`: Check if the main and renderer processes have been built. These processes must be build before running E2E tests
- `check-node-env.js`: Assert that `NODE_ENV` is the expected value. Throw if assertion fails
- `check-port-in-use.js`: Finds a free port if default port for ERB is in use
