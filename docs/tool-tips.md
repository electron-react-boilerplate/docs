## How to keep commit history clean

When you clone this project and down the line keep your copy updated with the upstream, you end up with lot many commits that are made by contributors to this boilerplate. Meanwhile you too keep committing in your copy in order to develop your project. You may feel that your `git log` is polluted with commits made to this boilerplate, when you prefer `git log` to show only those commits that are directly related to your project. 

One workaround is to use `--depth 1` switch in your `git clone` and `git fetch` command.

For example,

```bash
# When cloning this boilerplate for the first time
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git your-project-name
# To fetch updated copy of boilerplate
git fetch --depth 1 git@github.com:chentsulin/electron-react-boilerplate.git
```

## How to add _missing_ +flow-type+ definitions for third party modules

If flow definitions for a module are missing, flow will raise `"Required module not found"` errors.

For example, clone this repository. Add +material-ui+ to `./package.json`. 

```bash
yarn add material-ui
```

Then add this line to `Counter.js`

```js
import AppBar from 'material-ui/AppBar';
```

If flow is enabled, it will produce following error,

```js
file: 'file:///<Your path>/electron-react-boilerplate/app/components/Counter.js'
severity: 'Error'
message: 'material-ui/AppBar (Required module not found)'
at: '4,20'
source: 'flow'
```

To get around this issue, add `./flow-typed/<module-name>_vx.x.x.js` file, like `./flow-typed/material-ui_vx.x.x.js`. Then add following lines to it,

```js
declare module 'module' {
  declare module.exports: any;
}
```

In our example, it would be

```js
declare module 'material-ui' {
  declare module.exports: any;
}

declare module 'material-ui/AppBar' {
  declare module.exports: any;
}
```

This would turn off flow-typed errors for the module.
