Webpack is one of the most crucial parts of ERB's infrastructure as with many other React projects. It provides us with many optimizations such as dead code stripping, tree shaking, and code splitting to name a few. Webpack allows you to scale your application and add many components and layers of abstraction without sacrificing the performance of your app.

## Build an App

Building a production version of your app will optimize the JS, CSS, and SASS of your application.

To create a production build, run `yarn build`:

```bash
yarn build
```

## Inspecting Build Size

If you want to reduce the build size of your app, you can open a treemap of your build:

To create a production build, run `OPEN_ANALYZER=true yarn build`:

```bash
OPEN_ANALYZER=true yarn build
```
